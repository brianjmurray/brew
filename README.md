Keeping MacOS up-to-date with brew

I keep these files in my iCloud documents folder. This way I've used it to setup a new Mac after signing in to iCloud and syncing files (and after installing homebrew - https://brew.sh). I also run in every other week or so to keep the OS, App Store apps and brew apps up-to-date. The Brewfile is the list of applications I have installed that can be managed this way. 

If an application is no longer wanted I need to uninstall it and remove it from the Brewfile so that it won't get re-installed.

To use this same method I would suggest forking the project and removing my Brewfile ( I included it as an example and a backup for myself) and run the update.sh so that your own Brewfile will be generated based on your collection of applications.
