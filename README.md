Keeping MacOS up-to-date with brew

I keep these files in my iCloud documents folder. This way I've used it to setup a new Mac after signing in to iCloud and syncing files (and after installing homebrew). I also run in every other week or so to keep the OS, App Store apps and brew apps up-to-date. The Brewfile is the list of applications I have installed that can be managed this way. 

If an application is no longer wnated. I need to uninstall it and remove it from the Brewfile so that it won't get re-installed.
